# Piktoria

A little project to practice my skills in frontend and backend web development.

Piktoria is a website to see images in the form of posts. You can register in order to upvote and comment other people's posts. You can also create your own posts for others to see, upvote and comment.

The backend has been developed with NestJS. The database has been implemented with PostgreSQL and TypeORM.
The frontend has been constructed with React.
